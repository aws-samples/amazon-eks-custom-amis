# Amazon EKS Sample Custom AMIs

This repository contains [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) playbooks along with [Packer](https://packer.io/) definitions to create custom AMIs for use with [Amazon EKS via "bring your own" Auto Scaling Groups](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/worker.html).  Many organizations require running custom AMIs for security, compliance, or internal policy requirements. **The Amazon EKS Optimized AMI remains the preferred way to deploy containers on Amazon EKS, these AMIs aim to provide a starting place for customers looking to implement custom AMIs with operating systems other than Amazon Linux.** The AMIs built in this repository are based on the [Amazon EKS optimized AMI published by AWS](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-eks-ami).

## Installing Dependencies

This repository uses [Packer](https://packer.io/) and [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) to build AMIs. You can install these tools from their respective websites or via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/).

```bash
brew install packer ansible
```

You will also need to provision a VPC with a single public Subnet. You can leverage an existing VPC and Subnet or create one via the console. You will need the VPC ID and Subnet ID for the builds.

## Usage

The Packer commands are encapsulated in Make commands. Packer handles provisioning the instance, the temporary ssh key, temporary security group, and running the Ansible playbooks via the Packer SSH proxy. The Make command names can be found in the table above.

```bash
make AWS_REGION=us-east-2 AWS_VPC_ID=vpc-123456789abcdefgh AWS_SUBNET_ID=subnet-123456789abcdefgh build-centos-7
```

| Parameter | Default | Description |
|-----------|:-------:|-------------|
| `AWS_REGION` | | The AWS Region to use for the packer instance |
| `AWS_VPC_ID` | | The AWS VPC to use for the packer instance |
| `AWS_SUBNET_ID`| | The AWS Subnet to use for the packer instance |
| `K8S_VERSION`| `1.15.10` | The version of Kubernetes to install. See blow for information on how to get this value. |
| `K8S_BUILD_DATE`| `2020-02-22` | The build date of the Kubernetes build |
| `CNI_VERSION`| `v0.6.0` | The version of the Kubernetes Container Networking Interface (CNI) to install |
| `CNI_PLUGIN_VERSION`| `v0.7.5` | The version of the Kubernetes Container Networking Interface (CNI) plugin to install |
| `HTTP_PROXY` |  | Specify an HTTP Proxy to use when running commands on the server. This will set the `http_proxy` and `HTTP_PROXY` environment variables on the server while commands are running. |
| `HTTPS_PROXY` |  | Specify an HTTPS Proxy to use when running commands on the server. This will set the `https_proxy` and `HTTPS_PROXY` environment variables on the server while commands are running. |
| `NO_PROXY` |  | Specify the no proxy configuration to use when running commands on the server. This will set the `no_proxy` and `NO_PROXY` environment variables on the server while commands are running. |
| `HARDENING` | `none` | Specify the hardening to perform. Currently the supported values are `c2s`, `stig`, and `cjis`. These hardening guides are generated by OpenSCAP and only apply to Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 images. |
| `KMS_KEY_ID` | | Specify a KMS Key Id or ARN used to encrypt the boot volume and corresponding EBS volumes. |

### Encrypting AMI and EBS Disks with KMS

The `make` script support passing a KMS key [through to Packer](https://www.packer.io/docs/builders/amazon-ebs.html#kms_key_id) for each of the disks.

```bash
make AWS_REGION=us-east-2 \
    AWS_VPC_ID=vpc-123456789abcdefgh \
    AWS_SUBNET_ID=subnet-123456789abcdefgh \
    HARDENING=stig \
    KMS_KEY_ID=12345678-abcd-1234-abcd-123456789abc \
    build-rhel-7
```

### Fetching the Kubernetes Build Information

Amazon EKS builds and tests specific versions of Kubernetes together for compatability. It is important that you use versions that have been tested together. 

| Kubernetes Version | Build Date | CNI Plugins Version |
|--------------------|------------|---------------------|
| 1.18.8 | 2020-09-18 | v0.8.6 |
| 1.17.11 | 2020-09-18 | v0.8.6 |
| 1.16.13 | 2020-09-18 | v0.8.6 |
| 1.15.11 | 2020-09-18 | v0.8.6 |
| 1.14.9 | 2020-09-18 | v0.8.6 |

To get the list of support Kubernetes versions run the following command:

```bash
aws s3 ls amazon-eks --region=us-west-2
# ...
# PRE 1.14.9/
# PRE 1.15.10/
# ...
```

Once you select a version you will need to get the build date:

```bash
aws s3 ls s3://amazon-eks/1.15.10/ --region=us-west-2
# PRE 2020-02-22/
```

### Considerations

- This repository leverages the latest version of [Docker CE](https://docs.docker.com/install/) available from Docker. The version of Docker that comes with RHEL 7 is out of date and overidden with the Docker CE repository.
- Custom AMIs are only supported in the bring your own Auto Scaling Group configuration of Amazon EKS worker nodes.
- Hardening is provided as a "best effort" baseline and should still be independently validated by your organization's security team.

### Hardening

This repository supports standard Container and Operating System (OS) hardening guides.

#### CIS Benchmark for Docker

Sections 1, 2, and 3 of the [CIS Benchmark for Docker](https://www.cisecurity.org/benchmark/docker/) are applied during image build. Sections 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 do not apply to Amazon EKS deployments or apply directly to container images. In order to support Amazon EKS we have made a few modifications:

- `2.8 - Enable user namespace support` is not supported by the AWS VPC CNI Driver because it needs to access the host. This can be mitigated via Kubernetes Pod configuration.

#### DoD Security Technical Implementation Guides (STIG)

This repository also supports applying the [STIG from DISA](https://public.cyber.mil/stigs/). Currently, the only supported OS is Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7. The Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 STIG playbooks have been generated using [OpenSCAP](https://www.open-scap.org/) based on the [NIST Checklist](https://nvd.nist.gov/ncp/checklist/811). **These images are reference implementations and still needs to be validated by your security organization. These images are designed to be starting place for regulated environments.**

```bash
make AWS_REGION=us-east-2 \
    AWS_VPC_ID=vpc-123456789abcdefgh \
    AWS_SUBNET_ID=subnet-123456789abcdefgh \
    HARDENING=stig \
    build-rhel-7
```

#### Criminal Justice Information Services (CJIS)

This repository also supports applying the [CJIS hardening guidelines from the FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/services/cjis). Currently, the only supported OS is Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7. The Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 CJIS playbooks have been generated using [OpenSCAP](https://www.open-scap.org/) based on the [NIST Checklist](https://nvd.nist.gov/ncp/checklist/811). **These images are reference implementations and still needs to be validated by your security organization. These images are designed to be starting place for regulated environments.**

```bash
make AWS_REGION=us-east-2 \
    AWS_VPC_ID=vpc-123456789abcdefgh \
    AWS_SUBNET_ID=subnet-123456789abcdefgh \
    HARDENING=cjis \
    build-rhel-7
```

#### CIA Commercial Cloud Services (CIA C2S)

Currently, the only supported OS is Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7. The Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 C2S playbooks have been generated using [OpenSCAP](https://www.open-scap.org/) based on the [NIST Checklist](https://nvd.nist.gov/ncp/checklist/811). **These images are reference implementations and still needs to be validated by your security organization. These images are designed to be starting place for regulated environments.**

```bash
make AWS_REGION=us-east-2 \
    AWS_VPC_ID=vpc-123456789abcdefgh \
    AWS_SUBNET_ID=subnet-123456789abcdefgh \
    HARDENING=c2s \
    build-rhel-7
```

#### Hardening Notes

The following changes are made during the build process to the hardened image in order to support Amazon EC2 and Kubernetes:

- The `boot=UUID=<disk uuid>` from the grub boot configuration has been revmoed. This prevents instances from being stuck booting when FIPS mode is enabled
- The `net.ipv4.ip_forward=0` set by the STIG is overridden based on Kubernetes requirements to `net.ipv4.ip_forward=1`.
- The SELinux boolean `container_manage_cgroup` is enabled to support containers.
